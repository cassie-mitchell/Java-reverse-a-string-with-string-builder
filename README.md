# Java-reverse-a-string-with-string-builder

Strings in Java are immutable so we can turn them into a stringBuffer obejct and use the reverse method that comes with that
Or we can turn the string into a character array (using a built in method from the String class) and then do a for loop iteration through the array
Or we can keep it as a string and  get one character at a time with the String method charAt, looping through the whole string with a for loop or recursion
